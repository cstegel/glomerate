# Overview

Glomerate is a header-only, type-safe Entity Component System (ECS) created with C++11.  It aims to provide a simple API with scalable performance.  

It includes an event system which allows callbacks to be registered for user-defined events (Observer design pattern).

# Setup

Glomerate is a header-only library with no external dependencies (outside of testing) so all you need to do to use it is the following:

  1. add Glomerate's ```include``` directory onto your include path when compiling your project.
  2. ```#include <Ecs.hh>``` in any files you wish to use the library

It should work on any OS when using a C++11 compliant compiler.

# Example Usage

Below is a very simple example of using the ECS.  For the full API, see Entity.hh and EntityManager.hh.  Other practical examples can be found in "tests/integration/ecs.cc".

```c++
// glomerate's "include" dir must be on your project's include path
#include <Ecs.hh>

#include <iostream>

struct Position {
	Position() {}
	Position(float x, float y, float z) : x(x), y(y), z(z) {}
	float x, y, z;
};

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
	ecs::EntityManager entityManager;

	// not needed, but recommended
	entityManager.RegisterComponentType<Position>();

	ecs::Entity entity = entityManager.NewEntity();
	entity.Assign<Position>(1, 2, 3);

	for (ecs::Entity e : entityManager.EntitiesWith<Position>())
	{
		auto position = e.Get<Position>(); // returns an ecs::Handle<Position>
		std::cout << e
		          << " has x: " << position->x
		          << ", y: " << position->y
		          << ", z: " << position->z
		          << std::endl;
	}

	return 0;
}

```

Output:

```c++
(Index: 1, Gen: 0) has x: 1, y: 2,  z: 3
```

# Events

The event system can be used to easily allow callbacks to be triggered when specific events occur. Events are identified by any user-defined data type.  Callbacks can be registered to trigger when an event occurs...

1. on a single (specified) entity
2. on any entity
3. in isolation (not associated with any entity)

Callbacks registered for scenarios 1 and 2 above have the call signature ```void(ecs::Entity, const Event &)```.

Callbacks registered for scenario 3 have the call signature ```void(const Event &)```.

The ECS emits a special ```ecs::EntityDestruction``` event just before an entity is destroyed.

Below is a complete example showcasing most of the event system. For more examples, see the tests in ```tests/integration/Events.cc```

```c++
#include <Ecs.hh>

#include <functional>
#include <iostream>

using std::cout;
using std::endl;

// Event
struct IncomingMissle {
    IncomingMissle(int x, int y) : x(x), y(y) {}
    int x, y;
};

// Event
struct Explosion {
    Explosion(int x, int y) : x(x), y(y) {}
    int x, y;
};

// Component
struct Character {
    Character(int x, int y, string name) : x(x), y(y), name(name) {}
    int x, y;
    string name;
};

// Callback for when Explosion events occur
class ExplosionHandler {
public:
    void operator()(ecs::Entity entity, const Explosion &explosion) {
        explosionsSeen += 1;

        if (entity.Has<Character>()) {
            ecs::Handle<Character> character = entity.Get<Character>();

            if (character->x == explosion.x && character->y == explosion.y) {
                entity.Destroy();
            }
        }
    }
    int explosionsSeen = 0;
};

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
    ecs::EntityManager em;

    // announce character deaths when they occur
    typedef ecs::EntityDestruction Destruction;
    em.Subscribe<Destruction>([](ecs::Entity e, const Destruction &d) {
        if (e.Has<Character>()) {
            cout << e.Get<Character>()->name << " has died" << endl;
        }
    });

    ecs::Entity player = em.NewEntity();
    auto playerChar = player.Assign<Character>(1, 1, "John Cena");

    // player will be smart and moves out of the way of missles
    auto intelligence = [](ecs::Entity e, const IncomingMissle &missle) {
        ecs::Handle<Character> character = e.Get<Character>();
        if (character->x == missle.x && character->y == missle.y) {
            // we better move...
            cout << character->name << " has moved out of the way!" << endl;
            character->x += 10;
        }
    };

    ecs::Subscription sub = player.Subscribe<IncomingMissle>(intelligence);

    // We can also use functors (be sure to pass by std::ref to maintain state)
    ExplosionHandler explosionHandler;
    em.Subscribe<Explosion>(std::ref(explosionHandler));

    cout << "Firing a missle at " << playerChar->name << endl;
    int missleX = playerChar->x;
    int missleY = playerChar->y;
    player.Emit(IncomingMissle(missleX, missleY));
    player.Emit(Explosion(missleX, missleY));

    cout << playerChar->name << " stops paying attention (Uh oh)" << endl;
    sub.Unsubscribe();

    cout << "Firing a missle at " << playerChar->name << endl;
    missleX = playerChar->x;
    missleY = playerChar->y;
    player.Emit(IncomingMissle(missleX, missleY));
    player.Emit(Explosion(missleX, missleY));

    cout << "The explosion handler saw " << explosionHandler.explosionsSeen
         << " explosions" << endl;

    return 0;
}

```

This program produces the following output:

```
Firing a missle at John Cena
John Cena has moved out of the way!
John Cena stops paying attention (Uh oh)
Firing a missle at John Cena
John Cena has died
The explosion handler saw 2 explosions
```

# Tests

Existing tests can be run on linux with "make tests" to run integration and unit tests or "make integration-tests" / "make unit-tests" to run the individual suites.

googletest library is used to help with testing and it will automatically be cloned from github into the ```ext/``` directory when compiling the tests for the first time.

# Performance

By default, Glomerate uses std::unordered_map for storing indexes. On some
platforms (in particular VC++), std::unordered_map performs poorly and should
be replaced. This can be done by defining the GLOMERATE_MAP_TYPE macro before
including any Glomerate header. For instance:

```c++
#include <boost/unordered_map.hpp>
#define GLOMERATE_MAP_TYPE boost::unordered_map
#include <Ecs.hh>
```

Any type with a similar interface can be used.

# License

Glomerate uses the MIT license. See LICENSE for more details.

It also uses part of boost so the Boost license also applies. This can be seen in ext/boost/LICENSE_1_0.txt

If you build the tests then googletest and googlemock will be retrieved which are governed by their own open source licenses. This can be seen in ext/googletest/googletest/LICENSE and ext/googletest/googlemock/LICENSE.
